# Exam Schedule Management System

This document describes the implementation of role-based access control for the exam schedule management system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Role-Based Access Control

The system now supports different access levels based on user roles stored in localStorage:

- **Students**: Can view their personal exam schedules and public exam schedules
- **Faculty**: Can view their personal exam schedules and public exam schedules
- **Admins**: Can view, create, edit, and delete all exam schedules

### 2. API Integration

The system integrates with the following API endpoints:

#### Public Access

- `GET /api/v1/exam-schedules/public` - Get public exam schedules with filtering options

#### Authenticated Access

- `GET /api/v1/exam-schedules/my-schedule` - Get personal exam schedule (students/faculty)
- `GET /api/v1/exam-schedules` - Get all exam schedules (admin)
- `GET /api/v1/exam-schedules/{schedule_id}` - Get specific exam schedule (admin)
- `POST /api/v1/exam-schedules` - Create new exam schedule (admin)
- `PUT /api/v1/exam-schedules/{schedule_id}` - Update exam schedule (admin)
- `DELETE /api/v1/exam-schedules/{schedule_id}` - Delete exam schedule (admin)

### 3. Advanced Filtering

The exam schedule page includes comprehensive filtering options:

- **Semester**: Filter by semester (1-8)
- **Year**: Filter by academic year (1-5)
- **Batch**: Filter by student batch (e.g., "20", "21")
- **Exam Type**: Filter by exam type (midterm, final, quiz, assignment)
- **Room**: Filter by examination room
- **Date**: Filter by specific exam date

### 4. Components Created/Updated

#### New Components

- `CreateExamSchedule.tsx` - Form to create new exam schedules (admin only)
- `EditExamSchedule.tsx` - Form to edit existing exam schedules (admin only)
- `ExamFilterBar.tsx` - Advanced filtering component

#### Updated Components

- `ExamSchedule.tsx` - Main exam schedule component with role-based features
- `ExamTable.tsx` - Table component with admin action buttons (edit/delete)
- `examScheduleService.ts` - Complete API service implementation

### 5. Routes Added

- `/admin/exam-schedules/create` - Create new exam schedule (admin only)
- `/admin/exam-schedules/edit/:scheduleId` - Edit exam schedule (admin only)
- `/admin/exam-schedules` - Admin exam schedule management (redirects to main page)
- `/schedule` - Main schedule page with both class and exam tabs

### 6. User Interface Features

#### For All Users

### 7. Data Management

#### Legacy Format Support

The system maintains backward compatibility with the existing exam data format while supporting the new API structure.

#### Error Handling

- Fallback to cached data when API is unavailable
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states for better UX

#### Authentication
